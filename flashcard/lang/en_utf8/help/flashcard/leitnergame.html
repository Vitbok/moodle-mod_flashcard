<h3>Leitner mode</h3>

<p>As designed by a german engineer, Sebastian Leitner, in 1970, this training method uses a spaced repetition of memory sollicitation to reinforce the footprint in the memory.</p>
<p>In Lietner mode, you will be presented a set of decks in decreasing difficulty order from left to right.
When starting the game, all the cards stand in the leftmost deck (the hardest). You will have to browse the deck, picking each card in turn and guessing the other side. You will then tell the system if you were right or wrong.
<p>If you tell you had <b>the right answer</b>, the card will shift to the immediate following deck at its right. Conversely, the card will remain in is original deck. The game ends when all cards could migrate to the rightmost deck.</p>
<p>The system tells you when to review a deck. Your teacher will have setup the frequency of your reviews for each deck. the teacher may also enable an "eroding" feature by which the cards could shft back to an harder deck if you do not come often enough to make reviews.</p>
